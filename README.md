# Hey there :wave:

> My name is Fredrick O' Cilamhain. I am a second year college student living in my parents home (sad ikr?) in Dublin, Ireland. There are two sides to myself. Fred, myself, a carefree - happy-go-lucky - academic, and O' Cilamhain, my blood, the fragments of a broken family recklessly glued together. This is my story.

`December 3rd, 1655`

The Milkons line, dating back as far as my post-adolecent mind shall elect to remember, consists of drunken sailors, easy bar maids, and corrupt politicians. Despite these challenges however, my farm is doing well, and this quarter, I have managed to attain a strong crop yield. My children shall eat for another winter. Hurrah! The plague makes travelling awkward, and I have not seen my missus for many harvests. The cold sunk in two fortnights ago, but alas now the wind has come too. Our shelter creaks louder with every passing night, and I fear the youngest may not make it through this harsh and unforgiving December. The echos of the Cromwellian regime are still felt by the town elders who suckle on the few remaining potatoes that rooted this fall. It is in days like these I thank god I went into beets...

`December 20th, 1655`

The air is cold here. But I fear my heart is getting even colder. There have been many a terrible night of woman beating and sleepless child as the roots have turned black. The plight has taken it's toll over our village. The elders of which I spoke have turned to rot and now feed the remaining crops, hopefully so us few left may eat again soon. My beets are still going strong I am proud to say. Alas though, they have been seized by the brits, and we have been left to starve. Oh, the humanity!

Calum has pneumonia, and my eldest Fiona has taken many a man to keep herself warm and fed. That whore. My youngest, god bless her, hasn't the looks to do the same. Butherface as we call her, is now working part time with the blacksmith. She wishes she could follow Fiona's entrepreneurship... she has a beautiful body, a rich personality... but her face.

I shall write again soon, should fate allow. God have mercy on us... merci.
