# Hey there :wave:

My name is Fredrick O' Cilamhain. I am a second year college student living in my parents home (sad ikr?) in Dublin, Ireland. There are two sides to myself. Fred, myself, a carefree - happy-go-lucky - academic, and O' Cilamhain, my blood, the fragments of a broken family recklessly glued together. This is my story.

`December 3rd, 1655`

The Milkons line, dating back as far as my post-adolecent mind shall elect to remember, consists of drunken sailors, easy bar maids, and corrupt politicians. Despite these challenges however, my farm is doing well, and this quarter, I have managed to attain a strong crop yield. My children shall eat for another winter. Hurrah! The plague makes travelling awkward, and I have not seen my missus for many harvests. The cold sunk in two fortnights ago, but alas now the wind has come too. Our shelter creaks louder with every passing night, and I fear the youngest may not make it through this harsh and unforgiving December. The echos of the Cromwellian regime are still felt by the town elders who suckle on the few remaining potatoes that rooted this fall. It is in days like these I thank god I went into beets...

The air is cold here. But I fear my heart is getting even colder. There have been many a terrible night of woman beating and sleepless child as the roots have turned black. The plight has taken it's toll over our village. The elders of which I spoke have turned to rot and now feed the remaining crops, hopefully so us few left may eat again soon. My beets are still going strong I am proud to say. Alas though, they have been seized by the brits, and we have been left to starve. Oh, the humanity!

Calum has pneumonia, and my eldest Fiona has taken many a man to keep herself warm and fed. That whore. My youngest, god bless her, hasn't the looks to do the same. Butterface as we call her, is now working part time with the blacksmith. She wishes she could follow Fiona's entrepreneurship... she has a beautiful body, a rich personality... but her face.

I shall write again soon, should fate allow. God have mercy on us... merci.

`January 2nd, 1656`

A new year, they tell me. I checked twice, for nothing about this morning felt new. The wind still whistles like a tax collector at confession, and the roof still leaks with the enthusiasm of a drunk promising reform. We rang in the year with a half-candle and a beet we pretended was a goose. Spirits were high until someone tried to carve it.

Calum yet lives, which is either a miracle or proof that pneumonia has grown bored of us. Fiona returned home smelling of gin and regret, jingling with coins that once had better dreams. Butterface, God forgive me, has learned to swing a hammer with real authority. The blacksmith says she has “the arms of a man and the temperament of a mule,” which I believe is praise.

I resolved this year to be kinder, warmer, and less resentful of the English. By noon I had failed all three.

`January 14th, 1656`

Snow today. Proper snow. The kind that makes you nostalgic for last week’s misery. It covered the fields like a clean sheet over a corpse... polite, but dishonest. The beets beneath are frozen solid, refusing to die or live, much like myself.

The Brits came again, this time apologetic. Apparently they seized the wrong beets last time. These ones were also ours, but they were sorry about it now. One soldier slipped on the ice and fell directly into a dung heap. I laughed so hard I forgot to be oppressed for a full minute.

Fiona is talking of leaving with a merchant bound for Cork. She says there’s opportunity there. I asked what kind. She said, “The usual.” Butterface asked if Cork had blacksmiths. Hope is a dangerous thing.

`February 1st, 1656`

Saint Brigid’s Day. We celebrated by not dying. A modest success. I wove a cross from rushes and hung it over the door. It fell immediately and struck me on the head. An omen, perhaps, or just poor craftsmanship. Hard to say as both run in the family.

Calum coughed up something unspeakable this morning and then asked for food, which I took as a sign of recovery. I fed him beet broth so thin it could be read through. He smiled anyway. Children are fools.

Butterface burned her hand at the forge but did not cry. Fiona cried instead, though no one knows why. The wind howls still, but less angrily now. I can only hope that it’s tired of us and considering easier prey.

`February 18th, 1656`

The thaw has begun. Mud everywhere. The world has turned to soup. With it comes the smell—of rot, of life, of things starting again whether we like it or not. I found three beets that survived the frost. I kissed them. No one saw. I think.

Word is Cromwell’s shadow is finally lifting, though it may simply be stretching. The elders are gone, the village quieter, and yet there is talk of planting. Insane, hopeful talk. I find myself joining in.

If we make it to spring, I swear I will complain less. Or at least with more gratitude. Should I not write again, assume I have either perished or become British. God save me from both.
